## Description

Welcome! This repository hosts the website I produced during the course [CSS to the Rescue](https://github.com/cmda-minor-web/css-to-the-rescue-2223) of the minor [Web Design and Development](https://everythingweb.org/). During this course I was challenged to create a 3D Rubik's Cube, using only HTML and CSS. The only Javascript file I was allowed to use enabled me to use range inputs in CSS.
